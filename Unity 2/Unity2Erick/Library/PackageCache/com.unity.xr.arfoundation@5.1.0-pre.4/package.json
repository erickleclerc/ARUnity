This functionality was replaced by the [Feature](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.Feature) flags enum in AR Foundation 3.1, and `LightEstimationMode` has since been unused.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where `UnityEditor.XR.Simulation.SimulationEditorUtilities` could incorrectly throw a `NullReferenceException` when you opened the Editor if no XR Plug-in was enabled for the standalone build target.\n- Fixed an issue for the XR Simulation camera where looking down or up would incorrectly affect the direction of movement in some cases.\n- Fixed an [issue](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/opengl-xrsimulation-does-not-show-scene-gameobjects-when-using-opengl-graphics-api) for the XR Simulation background where the depth value would be incorrect for graphics APIs using non reversed depth buffer."
